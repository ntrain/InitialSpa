**Overview: Application overview and purpose**

In my house, movies are not only a pastime, but they are also a way to communicate and learn lessons. Many times, we come to a standstill as to which movie do we watch. To settle disputes and take the decision out of our hands and into that of chance, I chose to create my SPA called Movie Decider.

**Functionality: Features and functionality description**

To accomplish this and follow the constraints of the assignment outline, I had to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But first I drew a design of what I wanted the page to look like. From this I planned to create what I hoped to be a great single page application that would allow the user to enter two or more movie titles when prompted. When finished the user would be prompted to select the Randomizer button which would shuffle the user entries and select one movie title to watch at that time. 

**Choices and Challenges: Development process choices and challenges**

When this assignment was started in class I followed the prompts to copy the template set forth in the CS1030Web Github repository. However, I became frustrated working with it when I was home, so I created a new Github repository and file that consisted of two files: index.html, and CSS.  Things seemed to be working fine until I returned to class and realized following the template was the best course of action and changed my work again.

I found myself wandering too much into the design realm and wanting to add extra's above and beyond the scope of the assignment and needed to reel myself in quite a few times to stay on target. I believe it was because of my lack of simplicity and desire for everything at once, that ultimately put me behind. In the end, the application that I submitted is not even close to my vision and I am unhappy with it.

However, I do still believe that when finished it could help break ties on which movie to watch, therefore, I have decided to continue working on it in my spare time.
