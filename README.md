This is an attempt to creacte a single page application to take the arguing out of deciding which movie to watch

The user selects the button to add a movie title to the application.
Once 2 or more titles are added, the user would then select the Randomize button.
The Randomize button would, in theory, shuffle the movie titles and choose one randomly.
Thus removing the unnecessary arguements that might arise from trying to decide which movie to watch.
